# Background
Throughout the 2024 Supercross season, there has been a concern from certain members of the media that Supercross is turning more into "Startcross"--i.e., a race in which your finish position relies largely on your start position--with the introduction of new rules and a perceived deeper field of racers. Thinking about this question, it should be fairly simply to address by using correlation metrics. Correlation measures the strength and direction (positive or negative) of the relationship between two variables. In this case, the two variables are finish position (response variable) and start position. Using a Pearson correlation coefficient, if we see a correlation of 1 between these variables, it means that finish position is entirely determined by start position, so if a racer starts 1st, the racer will finish 1st. A correlation of -1 means that if the racer started 22nd, the racer will definitely get first.

# Basic Evaluation
We should probably start simple. We will plot the correlation between finish position and start position for ALL positions between the years 2018-2024. This is discrete data but a line is added for the convenience of the viewer.

This graph tells us that the correlation has actually dropped significantly for this year, which may seem counter-intuitive to what we see on the weekends. Note that the scale of the y-axis ranges from a little under 0.69 to almost 0.75, which is quite small. But still, it is a drop off. This could be because we are taking into account every single position you could finish in--from 1st to 22nd. When "Startcross" is referred to, it is usually in the context of the winner or at least top 5.

This graph says that in 2024, both for the podium and the winner, their average start position is lower on average than in previous years. So we will first look at the average start position for winners and the correlations for podium finishes only.

As we can see, the average start position for the winner has dropped in 2024 compared to previous years, and the correlation between start position and finish position for podium finishes has increased (i.e., a start has become more important).

We only see the correlation increasing in terms of the podium finishers. If we go to positions 4-10, we do not see this trend.

Several extra graphs are included after the summary for additional reference.

# Summary
The term "Startcross" has its merits, but only in the context of the top 3 finishers (which is pretty much the context it is referred to in) and to be fair, the correlation jump isn't huge, but it is something. For the rest of the field, starts are just as important as they have always been.

# Additional Graphs

This is a neat graph that shows for 2024 each finish position and the corresponding average start position that resulted in that finish position. I threw a basic linear model regression line to show what a linear model would predict was a start position given a finish position as input. Perhaps I should flip it next time so that we give it start position and it predicts finish_position. Either way, the point is articulated.
